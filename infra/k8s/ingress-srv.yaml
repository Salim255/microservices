  #This entire annotation section is what's going to help the ingress controller understand that we are trying to feed it some routing rules, so the ingress controller going to scan continuously all the different objects or all the different config files. So we are throwing into our cluster and it's going to try to find one that has this exact annotation
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx

    ##We need to add this to use regular expressions

  #Rules is going to have all the different routing rules that we want to apply to teach the ingress controller how to take the incoming traffic and route them off to our different pods

    - host: posts.com
